# Arduino-Lazer-Tag
This is the public repository for my school project of creating lazerguns using Arduino's

# Required Hardware
- 2x Arduino - I used two arduino nano's
- At least 1 USB cable
- working computer with the Arduino IDE running 
- 2x IR receiver
- 2x IR blaster or IR LED
- 4x Pushbutton's
- Resistors, for the led's, buttons and other components
- Batteries, kinda essential for mobility

Optional items that we used
- 2x LED lazer, for extra shooting effects
- 2x Piezo speaker, for buzzing sounds when you shoot, get shot or die
- 2x RBG LED, to signal your team and current health status
- Water pistols
- Lots of hot glue for sealing the water pistols

# How to build

# Build schematics, fritzing

# Future development ideas
- 3d printing the housings to make them more stirdy
